# RegistrationSystem
Registration management system for events. To access the registration panel, there is a login so that the main user can log in and his assistants. Likewise, the system already has a main administrator as I mentioned before with whom you can block the user or assign him a certain role.
Within the administrative panel, the main user (Administrator) may have full control of the application. The administrator will also have access to the following modules: Desktop, Donation, Registration, Profile, Configuration and User Management. And for the helpers according to the role they will be able to see some functionalities.


### Desk Panel:
Access to a quick view to have information and graphs of each of the modules.

### Donation:
Module where you can have a record of the donation, the data requested, the name (Optional) and Amount donated (Required).
The records remain marked in the database, so within the module you will find three buttons: New, Records and Delete.
> <strong>New:</strong> As the name indicates, more records can be added here.

> <strong>Register:</strong> Viewing the records, each registered thing can be modified or deleted (If you have the permissions).

> <strong>Remove:</strong> Basically it restores the module, cleaning all the records and without recovery.

> <strong>PDF or Excel generation:</strong> All records can be exported in PDF or Excel.

### Enrollments:
Module where you can manage any type of event:
(Workshop, Course, Congress, Webinar, Fair, Festival, Concert, Party, Convention...).
Basic registration:
Name, maternal surname, paternal surname, age, cell phone number, email and subscription (Optional).
The records remain marked in the database, so within the module you will find three buttons: New, Records and Delete.
> <strong>New:</strong> As the name indicates, more records can be added here.

> <strong>Register:</strong> Viewing the records, each registered thing can be modified or deleted (If you have the permissions).

> <strong>Remove:</strong> Basically it restores the module, cleaning all the records and without recovery.

> <strong>PDF or Excel generation:</strong> All records can be exported in PDF or Excel.
### Profile:
Module where any user can access and see the basic user information, likewise users can modify their profile picture, password and name.

### Setting:
In theory, it would be a basic configuration, such as the color of the administrative panel, but development has not yet been completed.

### User Management:
As mentioned before, the administrator has access to the new subscribers and from there they can deactivate or delete the account so that they no longer have access to the system.
The data that you can view are basic, such as name and email.
